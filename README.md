# Word-Crack-Automated
Full automation for the game Word Crack

You can get your cookie and user ID with some MITM proxy...

Upon execution, script will make a new game (if it can) and also play any of the open pre-existing games...

It's limited to only solve up to 320points worth of words at once... Anything higher could be "suspicious"...

ALSO: If you use this - it's pretty blatant since the words it solves don't always connect [ others can see that D: ]
 - Because their server apparently doesn't check for that - I'm gonna be lazy and call it a job done :)
